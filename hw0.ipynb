    "Let's unpack the arguments to this function a bit.  The function essentially mirrors that of the Python implementation, but requires passing some additional arguments because we are operating on raw pointers to the array data rather than any sort of higher-level \"matrix\" data structure.  Specifically, `X`, `y`, and `theta` are pointers to the raw data of the corresponding numpy arrays from the previous section; for 2D arrays, these are stored in C-style (row-major) format, meaning that the first row of $X$ is stored sequentially as the first bytes in `X`, then the second row, etc (this contrasts with _column major_ ordering, which stores the first _column_ of the matrirx sequentially, then the second column, etc).  We also assuming there is no padding in the data; that is, the second row begins immediately after the first row, with no additional bytes added, e.g., to align the memory to a certain boundary (all these issues will be mentioned in subsequent discussion in the course, but avoided for now). Of course, because only the raw data is passed into the function, in order to know the actual sizes of the underlying matrices, we also need to pass these sizes explicitly to the function, which is what is provided by the `m`, `n`, and `k` arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an illustration of how to access the data, note that because `X` represents a row-major, $m \\times n$ matrix, if we want to access the $(i,j)$ element of $X$ (the element in the $i$th row and the $j$th column), we would use the index\n",

    "X[i*n + j]\n",
    "```\n",
    "i.e., because `X` is $n$ columns, and stores it's columns sequentially, we'd need to access the `X[i*n]` element to access the $i$th row; and if we want to access the $j$th element in this row, we have the expression above.  The same logic would apply to the `theta` matrix, but importantly, because `theta` is a $n \\times k$ matrix, to access it's $(i,j)$ element you would use the index\n",

After you do so, you can test the implementation using the following commands."

    "As expected, the numbers match exactly our Python version, and the code is ... about 5 times slower?!  What is going on here?  Well, it turns out that the \"manual\" matrix multiplication code you probably wrote for the C++ version is extremely inefficient.  While Python itself is a slow, interpreted language, numpy itself is backed by matrix multiplications written in C (or, more likely, Fortran, believe it or not), that have been highly optmized to make use of vector operations, the cache hierarchy of different processors, and other features that are essential for efficient numerical operations.  We will cover these details much more in later lectures, and you'll even write a matrix library that can actually perform these operations relatively efficiently (at least for some special cases ... it's honestly not that easy to beat numpy in general).\n",
